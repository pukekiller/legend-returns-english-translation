		<text>To what do I owe this pleasure?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_forest_0">
		<text>Tell me about the Red Forest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_forest_1">
		<text>This used to be a wildlife reserve, and I was the local forester. I protected the forest and its animals from poachers. Now the Zone itself protects this place, and it does it so well that people are willing to travel a dozen extra miles just to avoid it. If a stranger sets his foot in the forest, he's as good as dead. I may be Forester, but even I don't know exactly what goes on here. A man walks into the mist and just gets sucked off into nowhere. You could be walking right behind him and still not know how he met his end. So that's that, sonny.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_zone_0">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_zone_1">
		<text>The Zone, heh... The Zone has a life of its own, and we people just get in its way - some more, some less. The Zone works to neutralize any risk to its existence the same way our bodies fight diseases. We get a fever, and the Zone has its shakes too. Emissions - now those are a way to "barf" us up. The more irritation we cause to it, the stronger the new emissions will be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_zone_11">
		<text>How did you survive here all these years - alone and amidst all the dangers?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_about_zone_111">
		<text>One foolish action can destroy the Zone... along with everything that belongs to it. Not just mutants and anomalies, but also artefacts and you stalkers... and me. I can feel that the Zone is deeply concerned - something is upsetting it, disturbing its equilibrium. A storm is brewing... and I don't know if the status quo can be preserved. </text>

	<string id="red_forester_hello_dialog_1">
		<text>What's a rookie like you looking for in Forester's estate?</text>

	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_hello_dialog_4">

	<string id="red_forester_who_are_you_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_who_are_you_1">
		<text>What can I tell you about myself? I'm Forester. I've been here a long time; I've spent my whole life living next to this forest. I'm old. At my age you grow attached to your place of residence, no matter what it is. I refused to be evacuated after the accident at the power plant; I also survived the appearance of the Zone. I remember a flash on the horizon... many folks died that day, but the Zone spared me, you see? Heck, it didn't just spare me, it gave me a gift! I used to be able to find paths in the forest, and now I can feel out a safe path through deadly anomalies. Stalkers envy me, but I can't say I'm all that happy about my gift. You must understand that everything comes at a price. Some day the Zone will take payment for my gift. That's what I am afraid of, buddy. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_who_are_you_111">
		<text>No, this was your typical pine forest. Well, it was also a nature reserve, but that was about as special as it got at the time. It became red after the accident at the Chernobyl NPP in 1986. It was green when I went to bed, and when I woke up it was as you see it now. Then the Zone appeared, and animals and birds abandoned this forest. I was the only living being that stayed behind. Just me, a red forest and this thick mist that never clears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="red_forester_who_are_you_11111">
		<text>Yes, many stalkers have met their end here. I've even heard rumours that an evil spirit lives in the Red Forest. The way I see it, this forest is just like everything else in the Zone. If you treat it right it won't touch you. The trouble is you stalkers don't treat anything right. You seek to own parts of the Zone and in return you get... what you're due.</text>

		<text>Here is the key, as per your request.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="key_4">
		<text>Excellent. HereТs the situation: our faction once engaged in an operation to mass produce gravity guns, based on model sixty-two, under the codename СCerberusТ. However, our only model, along with the respective blueprints, was stolen by StrelokТs group.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="key_5">
		<text>What do I need to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="key_6">
		<text>Your task is to enter hotel Polissya in Pripyat, find room number twenty-six, and retrieve the gravity gun, together with its blueprints. Judging by my sources, a stash left behind by StrelokТs group is located there. And- here. Take this psy-helmet; it will protect you from psy-emissions.</text>

		<text>Anything of interest?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="key_10">
		<text>Of interest? This is exactly what I had hoped to see. No longer do we risk this information falling into the wrong hands, and we shall restore the production of this weapon at once. You can keep the Cerberus; youТve earned it. Kurkul will be able to provide you with the ammunition necessary to operate such weaponry.</text>

		<text>How can I help the brotherhood?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="old_sinner_1">
		<text>A reliable source has come with some information. Duty is planning to seize part the Forest, going so far as to conscript free stalkersЕ The general is a naive idiot; he didnТt even think to consider keeping this operation secret!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="old_sinner_2">
		<text>What is my task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="old_sinner_3">
		<text>You must enlist in their ranks under the guise of an ordinary stalker and report back any information that you gather to me. This will provide as your disguise. Here you go.</text>

	<string id="old_sinner_4">
		<text>Understood. IТm on the move.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="old_sinner_done_0">
		<text>The operation was a success; the squad of storm troopers has been liquidated. I was unable to escape without making some noise, though, and in the course of the operation, the leader of Duty and other inhabitants of the Bar were killed. Morpheus and our other brothersЧthose who had been notified of my troubles from ShamanЧcame to my rescue.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="old_sinner_done_1">
		<text>I am already aware, as Morpheus has notified me of the situation. You have displayed true devotion, bravery, and composure, and for that, I shall grant you one of two existing exoskeleton models we have: the Minotaur.</text>

		<text>It is all thanks to Shaman. HeТs said that a brother of ours has been waiting for trouble, and showed us a way underground to here, straight from the Bar.</text>

		<text>Who is that?</text>

		<text>We are having a few problems with the Brain Scorcher: it overheats too often, making additional cooling necessary, which means periodically turning off the installation.

	</string>
	<string id="cresh_intro_2">
		<text>What do I need to do?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="cresh_intro_3">
		<text>There is a prototype of our installation in laboratory X-8, called the Rainbow emitter, and our team is currently collecting data about the prototypeЕ in hopes of understanding why the Brain Scorcher heats up to such extents.

		<text>Evidence of rumours, which I have already mentionedЕ Sin does, in fact, have a stalker who sees and hears all living things in the ZoneЕ and he is known as Shaman.

	<string id="haron_next_7">
		<text>Judging by the documents, this is the same Gauss rifle as the one we have, but with a slightly different power system. A good thing that you also managed to grab the blueprints for it, because without them, itТs unlikely that the Sinners will have the chance of producing these weapons any further.
