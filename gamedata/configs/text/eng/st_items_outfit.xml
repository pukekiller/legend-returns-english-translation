The suit has an integrated air-filtering and air-conditioning system, it is also heat and electricity resistant and provides good protection from radiation and biological anomalies. It is resistant to chemically aggressive environments. It is not designed for combat, so it provides little bullet and splinter protection. The suit has two artefact containers.</text>

		<text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_outfit_description">
		<text>This modern version of the Duty bodysuit is better suited for stalkers who are used to or prefer lightweight suits. Unlike the PSZ series, this suit also provides good protection against anomalies. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system instead.</text>

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
		<text>PSZ-9d body armour</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is based on the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour and modified for used in the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Duty scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>A wonderful protective suit for the Zone, mostly appreciated because it combines both excellent anomaly and bullet-proofing qualities. It includes the PSZ-9d suit, a closed cycle breathing system and an integrated system of anomalous field suppression. Whilst it provides quality bullet and splinter protection it does not come with an artefact container.</text>

		<text>Duty exoskeleton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>Duty's exoskeleton uses heavier materials to improve bullet resistance over that of others, this version of the exoskeleton though heavy makes one feel like a tank. The only downfall is the weak anomaly protection provided with the armour is very lacking and even the most basic of anomalies can often incapacitate or kill whoever sits inside it. Does not come with an artefact container.</text>

		<text>Sentinel of Freedom</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armour comprises armour plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artefact container.</text>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Freedom scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced by Freedom especially for research in the Zone. The closed system of breathing and special treatment materials provide excellent protection against harmful radiation and anomalous effects. However, the built-in body armour isn't the best and can break somewhat easily, so is not suitable for active hostilities. Fully upgradeable and boasting built-in artefact container.</text>

  	<string id="svoboda_exo_outfit_description">
    	<text>An upgraded version of a regular exoskeleton. The use of lighter materials allowed the designers to reduce the suit's weight and with Freedom's usual trademark of high quality anomaly protection, the only thing that suffers is its overall armour and impact. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

	<string id="novice_outfit_name">
		<text>Leather jacket</text>
	</string>
	<string id="novice_outfit_description">
		<text>The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions since it's simply a leather anorak. Typically, it is also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. Leather offers little protection from gunfire or claws and is absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_name">
		<text>Sunrise suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of twin-layered rubberised cloth with Plexiglas lining and built-in body armour. Despite the fact that the body armour is often strained by anything beyond even pistol bullets, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential.

		<text>Bar guard uniform</text>
  	</string>
  	<string id="barmerc_outfit_description">
		<text>The uniform used by guards in and around the 100 Rads bar. Its design is based on the outfit used by mercenaries around the Zone. Due to a special treatment of the fabric, the armour has much strengthened stability to offset the physical movement of its plates. Its protective properties are slightly better then those of the PSZ-7 military bulletproof suits.</text>

		<text>SEVA suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defence Research Institutes, is a great alternative to home-made stalker suits. The anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none.

	<string id="exo_outfit_description">
		<text>An experimental sample of an exoskeleton that was never mass-produced due to extraordinary cost and design flaws.

		<text>The M40 was the result of a program in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst many factions, particularly the Mercenaries as while it may lack strong protection vs. anomalies it makes up for this by providing moderate bullet protection.</text>

		<text>Tourist's overalls</text>
	</string>
	<string id="tourist_outfit_description">
		<text>The former owner of this thing was a real tourist, and, it's seen, more than once he was hiking in difficult paths, on the verge of human abilities. He knew how to correctly distribute the weight that he carried and to what things give preference. Due to the weight reduction of the outfit without harm to the protection, it allows carrying more weight.</text>

	<string id="greh_outfit_name">
		<text>Sinner Cloak</text>
	</string>
	<string id="greh_outfit_description">
		<text>In appearance it looks like an ordinary leather cloak, spoiled by the teeth of blind dogs and shot through with all possible calibers. However, on closer inspection it becomes clear that pieces of artifacts were sewn in a particular way inside the cloak, protecting the wearer from radiation exposure. So far, among the stalkers there was no daredevil who was ready to wear a cloak such as this one. Unpopularity of this cloak is added by legends about the terrible deaths of stalkers who dared to wear it, somehow stained with contact with this accursed clothing.</text>

Competently arranged artifacts and Kevlar plates give their owner almost complete invulnerability from any influences found in the Zone.  Legend has it that the wearer of this cloak won't ever be able to remove it. When you look at it, you can feel a warmth spreading from it and you can hear a barely discernible whisper.</text>
