		<text>Nothing much to tell. I've had it good and I've had it bad, like most people. Stepped into a few anomalies, been a hostage to bandits... I came to the Zone a young lad, a long time ago. I was a gopher at first - anti-rads, armour-piercing ammo, that sort of thing. Then I worked for Sidorovich... Paying him back for saving my ass. As I pulled chestnuts out of the fire for him, I made some useful connections and branched out on my own as soon as I could to start delivering exclusive orders. So far I've been able to dodge everything life has thrown at me, but I've a feeling my luck is running out. At the same time, I've no desire to bust my ass for pennies any-more.</text>

		<text>Behold the Alpine - a real beauty. You can rest assured this pistol is one of a kind in the whole Zone. A unique model, very limited issue commissioned for a single special unit. It wasn't easy to obtain, I even had to involve one of my overseas associates. An expanded magazine, extra hard steel barrel, receiver made of extra strong polymers. Add the remaining 2,800 and this baby's yours.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_131">
		<text>Lookit, this is March. The pistol belonged to a mercenary called Wolfhound. A compact high-calibre shooter with short blowback and a lightened bolt. Wolfhound was one hundred percent scum, but he knew his weapons, gotta give him that. They say his favourite trick was to blow all four of his victims' limbs off and then his head - before it hit the ground. Anyway, that'll be 2,800.</text>

		<text>Here you go - Cutter, a submachine gun. Let me say it right off, don't you mind the appearance. It's a brand new model, not in serial production yet. It's a prototype, fresh from the armoury. The designers aimed to make a new-generation close-range weapon: a combination of high calibre, rapid fire and accuracy. So that'll be 8,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_212">

		<text>I reckon this is just what you need. Eliminator, a latest development. The whole batch was supposed to be shipped to Central Africa, but I got a 'sample' as a special favour from friends. An automatic shotgun with a large magazine and an excellent rate of fire. Yours for only 8,000.</text>
	</string>

		<text>Sure. Behold Storm, a submachine and grenade launcher in one. This prototype is a modified version of a conventional weapon designed for special units operating in the Zone. Technical innovation at its best from our Slavic brothers... Add 16,000 and it's yours.</text>

		<text>Here it is - GP37, a new-generation assault rifle. Accurate, reliable, and convenient with a built-in optical scope. It was previously owned by a UN observer. Their group was sent to the Zone to investigate. However, the situation turned for the worse... 16,000 and the rifle is yours.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_411">
		<text>Here's Tide. Based on a silent sniper rifle, it was specifically designed for military units to fight zombies. Tide yields rate of fire in favour of stopping power, allowing the sniper to pick off zombies one by one without disclosing his location. However, it then became clear that stalkers alone will be enough to stop zombies at the Barrier, so the rifle never reached mass production. This baby's yours for an extra 16,000.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_421">
		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_422">
		<text>Yeah. SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_431">
		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power. Add the remaining 16,000 and this baby's yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_432">

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_511">
		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armour is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_512">

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_611">
		<text>Specially for you, a SEVA suit. Everything just like you ordered - a closed-cycle respiratory module, thermal resistant, protective electrical circuit, and outer-surface anti corrosion materials. Plus several built-in artefact containers as a bonus. A must-have suit for any stalker. Toss in 24,000 like we agreed and it's yours.</text>

		<text>There it is, a combat exoskeleton as large as life. The best protection you can get in the Zone from bullets, claws or grenade fragments, with the exception of armoured vehicles. But it also takes after armoured vehicles in that it relieves your weight burden - within reason, of course. 48,000 and it's yours, warts and all... err... by that I mean batteries and servomotors.</text>

		<text>While I was living in the big earth I was a historian, I was quite fond of ancient Rome. Mastered Latin. That's why I was nicknamed Augustus.</text>

		<text>What interesting things can you tell me about being a military stalker?</text>

	<string id="avgust_dialog_2_6">
		<text>It's something like an elite. Special troops prepared for operations inside the perimeter of the Zone. They are mainly engaged in reconnaissance and mapping. If you spot stalkers dressed in a military style, you'd be better off trying to avoid them. They are dangerous guys.</text>

	<string id="sidorovich_info_1">
		<text>Спрашивай, только я ведь всего не знаю. Сам понимаешь, сижу тут целыми днями, а жизнь - она вся там, снаружи, в Зоне. Могу рассказать о Зоне вообще, а немного могу о ближайших окрестностях, где сам ходил.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_2">
		<text>Расскажи мне в общих чертах о Зоне.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_21">
		<text>Зона... Это, понимаешь, не просто круг в сколько-то там километров диаметром с центром у атомной станции... Это что-то странное. Очень странное. Знаешь, вряд ли кто-нибудь в нашем мире ответит тебе на этот вопрос. Я думаю, Зона - вообще не часть его. Отдельный, сам по себе, мир - опасный, странный... и чертовски привлекательный. А знаешь, почему? Да потому, что здесь каждый, если повезёт, может быстро разбогатеть. Причём чем ближе к центру Зоны проберёшься, тем быстрее по деньгам поднимешься.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_22">
		<text>Чем опасен этот «отдельный мир»?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_23">
		<text>Кхм... Да, в общем, ничем - вот только подохнуть здесь можно на каждом шагу. И не только от пули тупого зольда, хотя военных сейчас много нагнали... Смерть от пули - это, считай, самая приятная смерть в Зоне. А вот аномалии - это, знаешь... Такая смерть - это да, это страшно. Их даже мутанты стороной обходят. Кстати, о мутантах: тоже дрянь редкостная, «дети» Зоны, так что без оружия тут лучше не ходить. А вообще по поводу всяких опасностей лучше других сталкеров тебе никто не расскажет.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_3">
		<text>Как здесь можно разбогатеть?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_31">
		<text>Артефакты - вот основа всего. За всякие непонятные игрушки из Зоны многие с Большой Земли готовы отвалить целое состояние. Артефакты ценнее золота, бриллиантов и чистого плутония. Почему? Да потому, что ни одна драгоценность в мире не обладает такими сверхъестественными возможностями и делится ими со своим хозяином. Только прикинь: вешаешь ты, скажем, себе на пояс некую хрень - и пули начинают обходить тебя стороной! Что ещё? Ну, всякую мелочь можно часто встретить даже здесь, под боком. А вот за ценными экземплярами ходят только ближе к центру.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_32">
		<text>Кто-нибудь знает, что происходит в центре Зоны?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_33">
		<text>Да разное болтают. Тебе потом столько всякой всячины расскажут... только я во всю эту потустороннюю чушь не верю. Вот во что я точно верю, так это в то, что в центре Зоны полно ценных артефактов. Только вот людей, которые смогли бы оттуда вернуться, пока не встречал.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_4">
		<text>Что тут поблизости творится?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_41">
		<text>А! Ну, это предбанник Зоны. Армейский кордон. Относительно спокойно, разве военные иногда развлекаются, шмон наводят. Опытные сталкеры тут в редкость, только новички засиживаются, а кто и навечно остаётся, мда... Вот рядом совсем, на хуторе, лагерь новичков приютился. Смотри, нажимать на курок они тоже умеют, так ты не задирайся попусту. Что ещё? Ну, хорошего хабара здесь не сыщешь. За дорогой - АТП. На севере, за железнодорожной насыпью - укрепленная ферма, а на юге - блокпост. Кстати, кое-где вояки мины расставили, так что поосторожнее. Ещё в центре мост был, да повалило его. Вот, вроде, и всё.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_42">
		<text>Расскажи побольше о блокпосте.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_43">
		<text>Несколько солдат с приказом стрелять без предупреждения, потому лучше обходи его стороной. Если их обидеть, то могут вызвать спецназовцев с дальнего кордона. Те наверху такой шмон наведут, что у меня потом месяц клиентов нет... Командира зольдов знаю немного: любит он за воротник заложить. Вот благодаря ему и держусь пока здесь.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_44">
		<text>Расскажи побольше об упавшем мосте.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_45">
		<text>Да тут два шага в северном направлении - сразу и увидишь. Раньше там мост над дорогой был, а потом взял да и упал во время одного из выбросов. Военные там пост сделали и вроде как никого не пускают... Однако, можно проскочить во время смены караула.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_46">
		<text>Расскажи подробнее о ферме.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sidorovich_info_47">

Военные Зону не уважают, так она их за это тоже не любит. То и дело цинковые гробы увозят. Ну, что ещё сказать... Смотрят на всех свысока, как будто богами тут заделались. Сталкеровские законы не чтут, на помощь никогда не придут, хоть на глазах у них погибать будешь. Пристрелить могут - это да, запросто, не наказывают их за это... Правда, кое с кем я нашёл общий язык. Нужно же людям водку, журнальчики там разные где-то доставать? Ну, ты понимаешь, о чём я. Но попусту их не зли - смахнут и не заметят.</text>
