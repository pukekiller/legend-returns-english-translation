	<string id="st_wpn_abakan_descr">
		<text>A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the ageing AKS-74. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 meters away. This significantly increases the likelihood of hitting the target in comparison to the 1 round firing mode, which considerably improves kill potential, stopping power and armour piercing capability.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74_descr">
		<text>This weapon, designed in 1974, signalled the adoption of small calibre and low impulse rounds by Warsaw Pact countries. A descendant of the most popular assault rifle in the world, the AKS-74 has an even bigger muzzle brake, resulting in a reduction of what was already manageable recoil. This facilitates better accuracy and groupings, especially when fired in fast single shots or bursts. As before, the rifle is very simple and reliable.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_wpn_ak74u_descr">
		<text>Despite being similar to submachine guns in size, weight and tactical purpose, this weapon is classified as an assault rifle due to the fact that its internal mechanism is identical to that of the AKS-74. The weapon is notable for its mobility in close quarters and high armour-penetration capacity, while its drawbacks are its short effective range, despite the relatively long bullet range, a tendency to overheat and high ricochet propensity.</text>

		<text>The ultimate hand cannon - bulky, heavy and highly lethal. Developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 meters. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.</text>

		<text>This pistol was developed in the second half of the 20th century on the basis of the PM for use by special forces and scouting units. The front of the pistol's barrel is covered with an integrated silencer, while the bolt mechanism is short, which prevents a back-moving spring from being located inside it, and it is therefore situated in the weapon's handle. Morally obsolete, the weapon is still effective in the right hands.</text>

		<text>Производитель неизвестен. После детального осмотра оружия становится ясно, что оно пролежало долгое время около гравитационной аномалии, что положительно сказалось на убойности. Несмотря на ржавый внешний вид, все внутренние детали перебраны и смазаны.</text>

	<string id="st_wpn_vsk_descr">
		<text>Бесшумная снайперская винтовка ВСК-94 была разработана в Тульском КБП на основе автомата 9А-91 в качестве дешевого аналога ВСС Винторез. Кроме механического прицела, аналогичного 9А-91, винтовка комплектуется оптическим прицелом ПСО-1, адаптированным под баллистику используемых патронов с дозвуковой скоростью пули. Эффективный глушитель значительно снижает уровень звука при выстреле и полностью исключает дульное пламя. Это обеспечивает скрытное уничтожение целей на дальности до 400 м.</text>
